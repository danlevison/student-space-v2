# Student Space

[Student Space](https://studentspace.vercel.app/) is a web application designed for primary school teachers to manage rewards for students and provide daily tools for classroom management.

I created Student Space as a personal project to provide a one-stop platform for managing rewards for my primary school students and organising daily tools for classroom management.

## Features
- Login: Users can login via their gmail account.
- Points and Rewards: Teachers can reward students and table groups with points for their achievements, behavior, or participation in class. Students/table groups can accumulate points and redeem them for rewards after reaching a certain amount, as set by the teacher.
- Daily Tools: The website includes a timer that can be used for various classroom activities, a task-list to manage tasks and reminders, a randomiser to choose students for specific tasks or roles and an instructions tool that can be used to display instructions set by the teacher.
- Additional Tools: A simple form input to add students/table groups and an options menu with features including, edit students, edit tables, order A-Z and reset points.
- User-friendly Interface: The website offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that is easy to navigate and provides an efficient way for teachers to manage rewards and daily classroom tasks.
